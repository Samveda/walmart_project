# Autocorrelation	

- In time series data, autocorrelation is defined as the delayed correlation of a given series. On the other hand, serial autocorrelation is that type which defines the lag correlation between the two series in time series data.
- Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. 
- Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal obscured by noise, or identifying the missing fundamental frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies. 

## Write a function `q03_autocorrelation_plot` that :
- Take the dataset and plot the autocorrelation plot
